`KhG <https://khyzhnyakgroup.com/>`_ Operations Management team helps with bottlenecks/constraints in Operations and keeps the Operations going effectively.

We exploit and remove obstacles on the way to profit increase. We free up CEO time and resources from Operations for strategy and business development.

We consider that the weakness of the chain weakest link determines the chain strength. The same is true for organizations, even for business ones. One and only one constraint limits the company’s productivity and profit at a time.

Certain efforts applied to the constraint increase the company’s productivity and profit. While efforts applied to other points, with one exception, will not affect them.

We identify constraints in the company’s Operations and exploit and alleviate identified ones. We use the Theory of Constraints, and the Theory of Inventive problem solving, also known as TRIZ, other tools and methods, and the help of employees.

For the alleviation, we may change things, from modifying infrastructure and optimizing existing procedures, or adding new procedures/processes, to building new departments and changing the corporate culture.

Also, we manage Operations on day to day basis. These CEOs who would like to have emotional contact with their people may deal with only one COO on our side. Once we establish the management culture, we may help to hire new designated COOs and hand off the management to them.

Our COOs share experience and expertise for better Operations handling. We add new members to our COO team, so Operations offices grow with companies, while CEOs still deal with one person. Having a back-office team of COOs means CEOs will not deal with situations like “COO on vacation” or “COO is tired and fired” anymore.

We can build IT tools or modify/set up/deploy existing ones as well.

CEOs come to us when they:

- afraid to open inbox or respond to calls, where they may encounter angry clients or employees with difficult questions.
- decide to develop business and new strategies, but instead, spend time on firefighting in Operations.
- develop business, but problems in Operations wipe out all the development.
- feel that their companies may perform better.

We may help if:

- employees do the same operation differently each time, with an unpredictable result.
- clients repeatedly complain about delays and low quality.
- CEOs can’t find out why company results are lower than planned.
- employees complain about each other, quarrel, and quit frequently.
- employees produce a lot of waste.
- competitors excel with terms, quality or prices.
- companies stay backward in their markets.

Even if companies already have COOs, we may provide an audit of the Operations and add our experience and fresh look, assist COOs with Operations and Change Management.

We find COOs for companies without the management, bring them up to date, and pass the Operations management to them along with our supervision.

Our services are useful for small and mid-sized companies (10-150 ppl), that:

- get ready to scale up their operations, or
- recently had explosive development, and now have daily operations on fire, or
- cannot find appropriate COO for their culture.

We decipher Operations at almost any state, even if they are spread between heads of employees and Excel/G-tables. We find any constraint, especially if it is a chronic problem in the blind spot. We calculate the value for any job. We throw out the unneeded job from processes, but we know when to stop and when changes will not add value. We know how to get rid of rush jobs and work-to-rule. We may determine non-obvious bottlenecks in the infrastructure.

If we are unsure of a change, we plan and experiment deliberately, as scientists in the Large Hadron Collider.
We do not work with CEOs who look for operational slave-drivers for total control with whips. There are a lot of COOs around who believe in kick-driven management and will help with this. Also, we may be unable to help companies with paper document flow. In that case, you may need to go digital first.
