We are a Division of KhyzhnyakGroup. We organize and optimize the management of daily operations.

.. [What we do?]

We build organizational structures for you. We make the structures healthy and good enough to fit your needs. We operate and handoff them when ready.

.. [What’s the value for you? - REWRITE: Our Clients get maximum…?] - Эту часть бы вообще переписать!

We help you to get the maximum from your teams and your resources. We free up time for CEOs to work with strategies. We ensure the optimal use of resources. We support business expansion. Our structure and a good strategy provide an inflow of money to your company.

.. [How we create value?]

For this help, we do the following:

 - Set tactical goals on increasing value, produced by your company. We use the company strategy as a guideline. Our formula: Value = Benefits to users * Quality * Efficiency
 - Build up a culture of trust and commitment by teamwork principles from Google "Aristotle" project and Ray Dalio.
 - Create new and optimize old processes and KPIs in collaboration with the team.
 - Support daily operation with 4 Disciplines of execution.
 - Choose and optimize the tools. We may build custom tools from scratch.

For optimization, we use the Theory of constraints, and the Theory of Inventive problem solving, also known as TRIZ, other tools and methods, and the help of your people.

.. [What’s the result?]

As a result - cumbersome systems of work control become obsolete, and your people pull your company up and forward with pleasure, on their own.

Once we establish a management culture, we help to hire a new designated COO. We hand off the management to him/her.

.. [When Clients hire us?]

You may hire us, when you have a feeling that your company can perform better, or when something in daily operation is wrong, for example:

  - There is a risk of loss of new or old clients, caused by product dissatisfaction.
  - Your people do not work at full throttle and resign often. The system of staff control or kick driven management is cumbersome and time-consuming. The number of procedures and instructions is higher than the number of off-normal situations together. And there are 63 KPIs in the quarterly report, but it is still unclear how well the company performs.
  - Your company has invested a lot of time and money in new CRM/ERP tools, but the company result is not improved.

Also, you may hire us for business expansion. Startups may hire us too when they need a COO - a kind of a jack-of-all-trades.

.. [What clients hire us?]

Our services are useful for mid-sized companies (20-150 ppl), that:

  - get ready to scale up their operations, or
  - recently had explosive growth, and now have daily operations on fire, or
  - cannot find appropriate COO for their culture.

SOHO companies may also contact us.

.. [What’s important in our job?]

We add drive, initiative, responsibility, understanding of business needs to all your people. We show them how to excel in their work. We know how to get rid of rush jobs and work-to-rule. We build KPIs to control the progress toward company goals. We set effective processes along with the people.

.. [What are our limitations?]

Our services will not suit you if you believe in kick driven management or comprehensive instructions with task delegation and total control. But we will demonstrate good results, if you are looking for better management methods, or considering better results as the most important thing.
