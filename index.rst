.. [Кто мы?]

We are a Division of KhyzhnyakGroup. We organize and optimize Customer Support Centers.

.. [Чем полезны?]

We do the following:

- build new Support Centers from scratch.
- increase the effectiveness of existing Support Centers.

You may choose any model for cooperation. For example, BOT model. We may create a Support Center, operate it, and transfer to your company later. Or we may supervise the Center until you need this.

We prepare Suppor Centers, which:

- Solve all standard and some non-standard tasks for the support.
- Take responsibility for decreasing the number of common issues and increasing the number of valuable features.
- Support your engineering and marketing teams with Customers feedback.
- Make Customers happy even with denials in service.

.. [Что для этого делаем?]

For this we do the following:

- Implement the culture of trust, loyalty, attention to Customers, experiments, and innovations.
- Create a system of KPIs.
- Hire new people.
- Train people, both new and old.
- Organize processes, including training. We use simplified ITIL for IT support.
- Select and set up tools.

We prepare the Support, that allows your company to focus on your products. So your teams are sure that they get all useful information from your Customers.

.. [Сценарии, когда к нам обращаются?]

You may hire us, when:

- Your engineers are loaded with responses to Customer inquiries and questions instead of their direct job.
- Your Customers are unsatisfied after contact with your Support Center.
- Your Support Center does not pass valuable info to engineers and marketing.
- Your Support Center rejects accountability for problem-solving.
- Your people rotate within a few months.

.. [Тонкости нашей работы?]

We know, how to:

- Let people take responsibility for Customer satisfaction.
- Teach people to question and negotiate, so Customers are satisfied even with the denial of their requests.
- Interest people in constant increase of values of their job, and the teamwork.
- Aim people from mindless execution of procedures to the creation of value for Customers.
- Set up the optimal delivery of information.
- Set up a fast self-learning process for your people.
- Keep knowledge inside the Center.
- Create a distributed Support Center with remote work for most of the people.

.. [Ограничения:]

We do not work with companies, that:

- value processes and procedures above all and that just require total compliance of actions to a template, without any purpose, or
- do not value processes at all.

Unfortunately, our knowledge is useless in these situations.
