`KhG <https://khyzhnyakgroup.com/>`_ OCSM team manages online customer support and all back-office units. We also work with managed services providers, technical support or IT depts, DevOps teams, and similar units.

We engage customers in high-quality cooperation with support. We make Customer/Technical support units reliable, predictable, and effective. Also, we help with the creation of support infrastructure. As a result, we increase retain of customers and employees, decrease churn.

We create new customer support units and put existing ones in order. We manage units on an ongoing basis. Also, we hire new managers and pass the management to them, with our further supervision.

People request our assistance when their companies lose money on problems with customer support or its absence. MSPs ask for our help with the low quality of their manged services.

We catch up with the support team if its manager has quitted the company all of a sudden. But it is better to invite us in advance. Besides the assistance, we work as spare managers - follow up the situation, assist current managers, and step into their shoes faster.

We consider predictability and reliability the most important things in customer support. Also, we know how to do a lot of other actions besides processes and instruments setup:

- how to provide the extra mile, so that it does not harm but benefit the business.
- how to set up QA, so the QA helps the support instead of common punishment and demotivation.
- how to make Customers happy even with denials in service.
- how to upsell softly.

We use the standard + —Åase approach, along with simplified ITIL for IT support.

We do not manage technical teams that require technological leadership. However, we can find appropriate people and teach them the CS part.

We have not worked with Call Centers yet. But we have looked into it, and we may work with Call Centers.

We do not increase motivation with pep talks. If you need this, there are a lot of managers around with this skill.

How can we contact you if needed?
