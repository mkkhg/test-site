.. This are the rules that define how we work and cooperate with Clients and Colleagues.

.. class:: fw-bold

 Values:

The only value we share - time.

.. class:: fw-bold

  Owners:

- Owners spend 5% or more of net profit on the charity. Anybody may propose the charity targets, and vote for any target.

- Owners may not sell the company. However, owners may sell divisions and projects.

  - Owners pay 5% of the sum of the deal after taxes to people from the sold unit, proportionally to their salaries.

.. class:: fw-bold

  Everyone:

- Everyone has to maximize the value, created by the company. *Value = Benefits to Others X Quality X Efficiency.*

- Everyone suggests ideas of any size [#chad]_

- Anyone may declare a time-out if they think things are going in the wrong direction [#chad]_

- The person closest to a problem is the first responsible for figuring out how to solve it. [#chad]_

- Everybody either implements every innovation from anyone or explains in written form, why they will not implement it.

- Nobody fires people for cutting costs if there is any other choice. They may cut off profit, salaries, starting from top management, rearrange/reprofile people, if possible. But, repeating, they do not fire anyone if there is another choice.

.. [#chad] formulated by Chad Fulgham, as written by Charles Duhigg
